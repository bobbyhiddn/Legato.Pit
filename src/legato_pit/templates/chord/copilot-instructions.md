2. **Phase 2: Core** - Implement main functionality
3. **Phase 3: Integration** - Connect components, add polish, finalize

## Constraints

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Don't introduce unnecessary dependencies
- Keep the solution simple and maintainable
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
